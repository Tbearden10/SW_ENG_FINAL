We first tested cell (14,5) as it had a direction of 'DOWN'.
We repeated this process for cells (4,15), (6,3), and (15,19) for our other directions. 
These cells were chosen at random to spread the cell choices around the board.

We then tested cell (3,10) (which was a room) as it was not a doorway such its direction would be 'NONE'

We then tested cell (17,16) (which was a walkway) as it was not a doorway such its direction would be 'NONE'

Following these tests, we chose a group of cells in which we tested a standard room location,
room labal location, room center location, secrete passage, walkway, and an unused space.

All together, these test cases allowed us to ensure any type of space/cell in our board is correctly handled.
